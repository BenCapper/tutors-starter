# Typora

<span style="color: red">Be Aware:</span> Typora is currently free while in Beta testing, however this will change with the release of the official version.

Some features of Typora are <span style="color: red">not</span> currently compatible with Tutors but will be integrated over time. This includes the functionality mentioned below.

Typora adds additional functionality to the Markdown notation, such as `Highlighting`, `Diagrams`, `Maths`, `Emoji's`, and `Diagrams`. Unlike other editors, Typora is a Markdown only editor, meaning other files such as `properties.yaml` cannot be edited with this application.

However, Typora is unique, allowing the user to view the output of their markdown, as they write it. This greatly reduces the time required for testing page formatting.

To view the code which is in effect, just click the area which has been formatted. In this example, `Be Aware` is red due to a `<span>` tag, to see the code causing this, just click the content in question; in this case: `Be Aware`.
