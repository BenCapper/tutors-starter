# Tutors File Structure

The template Tutors course `tutors-starter` which you downloaded in the first lab contains a file structure. This is where your course is formatted and organised to successfully create a Tutors course website.

This section identifies each folder and its purpose.

## json

This folder is automatically generated when the command `npx tutors-json` is run in the terminal, when in the tutors-starter directory. The contents of this file are used by Netlify to build and deploy the Tutors site. This will be elaborated on further in later steps.

**Note**: If you are experimenting with the file structure and the `npx tutors-json` command is not applying changes correctly, just delete this folder and run the command again!

##  topic-0*

![Topic](img/f2.png)

As the name suggests, each topic folder represents a topic within a module, much like a chapter of a book.

You can create more topic folders by copy / pasting an existing one, just be sure to follow the naming convention `topic-**`, replacing the "\*" with digits.

## unit-*

![Unit](img/f3.png)

Units split each topic further, allowing for a clear definition between course content in each unit, and allowing for separate titles for each unit. 

You can create more unit folders by copy / pasting an existing one, just be sure to follow the naming convention `unit-*`, replacing the "\*" with a digit.

## book-* / talk-*

![Labs and Talks](img/f4.png)

The `book-a` folder represents a lab module, where you can use Markdown to easily outline steps for the class to follow. A Markdown guide is provided in later steps.

The `talk-*` folders represent presentations, these can be in the form of YouTube videos or `.pdf` files.

You can create more lab and talk folders by copy / pasting an existing one, just be sure to follow the naming convention `book-*`, replacing the "\*" with a character for labs, or `talk-*`, this time replacing with a digit.

`book-*` contains `img` and `archives` folders.

## img / archives

The `img` folder is where any images used within the lab must be stored so they can be linked to. It is important to note that each `book-*` folder has its own `img` folder and will not find images placed in any lab `img` folder other than its own.

The `archives` folder is where any archived files such as `.zip` `.rar` `.tar.gz` must be stored so they can be linked to and downloaded. Like the `img` folder, the `archives` folder is specific to the `book-*` folder it is contained in and will not find archives in another labs `archives` folder.
